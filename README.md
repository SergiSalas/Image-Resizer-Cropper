            $( ".resizeme" ).aeImageResize({ height: 250, width: 250 });
        });
      -->
      }}}

I USE: html, jQUERY, JAVASCRIPT, and css

to use: Index is the home, you have to create a directoris and organitzate the file into ./css  ./js, etc and have to read the imprts from index and modficate to use
